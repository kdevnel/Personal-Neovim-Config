This is my personal NeoVim config. It contains all the keymaps, plugins and LSPs I use regularly. The repo is structured according to various sources I've learned from.

# Installation

- Open NeoVim (`nvim` by default) and wait for installation to complete
- Quit NeoVim (`:q`) and restart to see all features.
